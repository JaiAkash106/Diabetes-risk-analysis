# AI-Based Early Detection of Diabetes Using Lifestyle and Genetic Data

## Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-driven pipeline for early detection of diabetes using lifestyle signals (e.g., diet, activity, sleep) and genetic risk markers. The repository is currently a scaffold intended to house data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation workflows.

## Objectives
- **Risk prediction**: Estimate diabetes risk from combined lifestyle and genetic features.
- **Interpretability**: Provide clear explanations of which factors influence risk scores.
- **Reproducibility**: Support repeatable experiments with documented datasets and configurations.

## Planned Repository Structure
```
.
├── data/               # Raw and processed datasets (excluded from git)
├── notebooks/          # Exploratory analysis and prototyping
├── src/                # Core pipeline code (ingestion, features, modeling)
├── models/             # Serialized model artifacts
├── reports/            # Evaluation reports and figures
└── README.md
```

## Getting Started (placeholder)
Once the pipeline is implemented, typical steps will include:
1. Place raw datasets in `data/`.
2. Run preprocessing to generate features.
3. Train and evaluate models.

## Contributing
If you plan to add modules or datasets, please:
- Keep raw data out of git.
- Document new features or model training steps in this README.
- Add tests where appropriate.

## License
License information will be added when the project structure is finalized.
